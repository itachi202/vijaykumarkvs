# school-project

Hello there, nice to meet you. 

This website might not be the best, but I have already done my best. 

but next time, it will be a better one. 

my website starts with the 'index.html', and it will accept any kind of details.

after that comes the 'school-project.html' which will open as soon as you click the submit button.

I have inserted some music on this page, which you will notice after a few seconds.

once you scroll down to the end of the page, you will see an arrow.

click that and you will be redirected to the next page that is 'page-2.html'

at the end, there is a form which apparently doesn't work because of github limitation.

if you are visiting this github page using a phone, then you will see 'View code' above this README.md.
click on it and then you can access the files freely.


UPDATE 

I have made some changes, and now there are some more pages.

Thank you.
